## Samples

The SDK comes with a number of samples that can be imported used from the `SequencePlugin Content/Core` directory.

## Upgrading to Unreal 5.4

If your project is currently on 5.2 or 5.3, then for this version you'll want to upgrade to 5.4. To do this close the Unreal Editor, Close your Code Editor. Right-click on your Unreal Project file. Then select Switch Unreal Engine Version, Choose 5.4 and click okay. Once done. Open your code editor and rebuild your source code.

As a way of future proofing we recommend installing visual studio 2022 in accordance with these docs as Unreal 5.4 and onward will be dropping support for visual studio 2019.
